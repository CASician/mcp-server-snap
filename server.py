    Service search near GPS position - It allows to retrieve the set of services that are near a given GPS position. The services can be filtered as belonging to specific categories (e.g. Accommodation, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.), or having specific words in any textual field. It can also be used to find services that have a WKT spatial description that contains a specific GPS position.
    Service search near a service - It allows to retrieve the set of services that are near a given service identified by its serviceUri. The services can be filtered as belonging to specific categories (e.g. Accommodation, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.), or having specific words in any textual field. It can also be used to find services that have a WKT spatial description that contains a specific GPS position.
    Service search within a GPS area - It allows to retrieve the set of services that are inside a rectangular area. The services can be filtered as belonging to specific categories (e.g. Accommodation, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.), or having specific words in any textual field.
    Service search within a WKT described area - It allows to retrieve the set of services that are inside a geographic region described using the Well Known Text (WKT) format. The services can be filtered as belonging to specific categories (e.g. Accommodation, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.), or having specific words in any textual field.
    Service search within a stored WKT described area - It allows to retrieve the set of services that are inside a geographic region described using the Well Known Text (WKT) format, by referring to the WKT with an identifier provided when the WKT is stored. The services can be filtered as belonging to specific categories (e.g. Accommodation, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.), or having specific words in any textual field. The list of available geometries can be retrieved from the Service Map in the Search Area selection box (with Search Range specific area). New geometries can be provided using the http://www.km4city.org/wkt web service which can store a WKT from a shp file or providing directly the WKT string.
    Service search by municipality - It allows to retrieve the set of services that are in a specific municipality. The services can be filtered as belonging to specific categories (e.g. Accommodation, Hotel, Restaurant, etc.), or having specific words in any textual field.
    Service search by query id - It allows to retrieve the set of services associated with a query stored using the Service Map user interface.
    Full text search - It allows to retrieve the geolocated entities (not only services) that match with a list of keywords. The results can be possibly filtered to be within a specified distance from a GPS position, or within a rectangular area or inside a WKT geolocated area.
    Service info - It allows to retrieve information about a service using its serviceUri, as an HTML (format query parameter set to html) or a machine-readable JSON document (format query parameter set to json).

    This API allows to search over services submitted as IOT devices. The main characteristic is that it can search for devices whose last values satisfy specific conditions, for example it allows to find all Weather_sensor devices in a geographic area whose last value of temperature is over 30 degrees.
    The results can be filtered to be within a specified distance from a GPS position, or within a rectangular area (wkt polygonal area query is not supported).
    Moreover, results can be filtered by the model used in IoT Directory to create the device, categories (nature or subnature) associated to the device, valueFilters reporting conditions (in AND) on the last value received for dynamic attributes (e.g. status:Active;temperature>=23). The results can be paged using fromResult/maxResults.
    Normally only public iot devices are returned, if you want to include private devices (your own or delegated to you) you have to send an access token in the Authorization header or using the accessToken query parameter.
    Data is indexed on elasticsearch only after any update on the context broker, thus if you change ownership or add a delegation on the device it will be applied only after a data update.
    Consider that the device status is updated on every device change on the context broker, thus if updates are made out of time order it is not guaranteed that the device status provided is the most recent
    Always specify 'selection' or 'model' or 'valueFilters' or 'categories' or 'serviceUri' parameter.

Not healthy devices are identified computing at update time the time expected for next update, not healthy devices are those whose value of this time is before current time (a configurable threshold of 1 minute is used).

The type is used to force sorting for dates and numbers. If the parameter is omitted the sort is on the distance from GPS position, if "none" is specified no specific sort is used.

    IoT device/value search over a time range
    This API allows to search over services submitted as IOT devices. The main characteristic is that it can search for devices whose values satisfy specific conditions in a certain time range, for example it allows to find all Weather_sensor devices in a geographic area whose value of temperature is over 30 degrees at least one time over last week. But this api can return all the temporal values matching the request (in this case a service uri is repeated as many times as it matches the query in the time range)
    The results can be filtered to be within a specified distance from a GPS position, or within a rectangular area (wkt polygonal area query is not supported).
    Moreover, results can be filtered by the model used in IoT Directory to create the device, categories (nature or subnature) associated to the device, valueFilters reporting conditions (in AND) on the last value received for dynamic attributes (e.g. status:Active;temperature>=23).
    The results can be aggregated by service uri with aggregation=true if data is not aggregated can be paged using fromResult/maxResults.
    Normally only public iot devices are returned, if you want to include private devices (your own or delegated to you) you have to send an access token in the Authorization header or using the accessToken query parameter.
    Data is indexed on elasticsearch, consider that ownership and delegations are not updated for old data, so if ownership or delegations of a device are modified at a certain point in time this api will provide to the new owner or delegated user only data submitted after this change.

The path is provided as WKT geometry and as a sequence of arcs between nodes (the service uses the OpenStreetMap road graph). The type of route can be specified as using public transport, feet, or car. The start datetime is used to select the options for public_transport and to evaluate the time needed to make the path
